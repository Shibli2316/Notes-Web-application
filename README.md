# Notes-Web-application
This is a notes web application made with the help of PHP.
You can use this application in the few simple steps:
1) Make a pull request of all the files from this repository.
2) Start your apache server and my sql database.
3) Make two new databases there one named users and other named notes.
4) In the notes database make a table named notes that has 4 columns, that is sno (int), title (varchar), description (text) and tstamp(timestamp).
5) In the users database make a table named users and insert 8 columns into it that is sno (int), name (varchar), location (varchar), phone (int), email (varchar), username (varchar), password (varchar) and dt (datetime).
6) Make sure to enable auto increment in sno which will make it a primary key.
7) Also choose the size of password to be 256 or above for the application to function properly.
8) In case you change the directory do make necessary changes in the location of form methods. GIVE FULL LOCATION of the files or it wont function as desired.

And there you are all set to go.
